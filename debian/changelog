  * copy in the entire contents of gnop and delete the entire contents
    of python-simplegeo-shared in order to see if the build works when
    it is identical to the working gnop build, then I'll incrementa lly
    change it back to simplegeo-shared and see when the build breaks Oh
    except, gnop isn't open source. So I'll just delete the actual
    bodies of the methods real quick...
  * just changing something to watch it change
  * random thing to make sure hudson notices pending has changed
  * put python-simplegeo-shared back now that I figured out what was
    wrong with the hudson config
